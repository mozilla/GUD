/**
 * Fail with an error message if this project has too many ESLint problems.
 *
 * Configuration options:
 *
 *    config.maxProblems: The maximum number of problems that should be allowed.
 *                        If the number of problems exceeds this value, the
 *                        script will fail with an error message. Consider
 *                        lowering this number over time, as problems are fixed,
 *                        to prevent regressions.
 *
 *    config.runFrom:     The directory that ESLint should be run from. Usually,
 *                        this should be the directory that contains your ESLint
 *                        configuration files, which is usually the project
 *                        root. The default is the directory that the script is
 *                        saved to. In other words, the default assumes that
 *                        this file is saved to the project root. If you saved
 *                        this file to a "scripts" directory, change the value
 *                        to path.join(__dirname, "..") to run ESLint from one
 *                        level up.
 *
 *    config.targets:     The targets to run ESLint against. By default, ESLint
 *                        will be run against all files in or below the
 *                        "config.runFrom" directory which end with a .js
 *                        extension or which match a pattern listed in the
 *                        "overrides" section of the ESLint config. These should
 *                        probably be the same targets that you specify in your
 *                        "lint" npm script, if you have one.
